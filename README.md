Here's a sample from my code. The code originates from my project and serves the purpose of showcasing my experience. Some parts are unfinished or left out. This is does not represent the full scope of the project.

Demo showcases the following:
1. EntityManager - Module for setting up entities / using statemachine.
2. StateMachine - Machine that controls the flow of the states.
3. BuffController - Handles buffs, such as passives, overtime effects and buffs/debuffs.
4. Data - Creates proxies to player's data, which can be connected to callbacks that fire when values are changed.
5. StateEnums - Current available states that statemachine manages.
